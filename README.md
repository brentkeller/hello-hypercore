This was an exploration into using `hyperdiscovery` for connecting peers. It links directly to a branch of `hyperdiscovery` that has some support for using `discovery-swarm-web` to assist in browser usages. I don't think I really got this right and I ended up going back to just using `signalhub` and `webrtc-swarm` which are currently in master (as of 2019.06.13).
